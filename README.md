# Talk Title

Not quite ready for an abstract yet. The general idea is that, increasingly, people seem uncomfortable doing TDD. They have rarely been taught it by an expert, instead trying to figure it out by themselves. This doesn't go well.

So the talk is to demystify the process, what works and what doesn't, where it fits contextually, the benefits, the downsides, some techniques that help.


# History

TODO history goes here.
