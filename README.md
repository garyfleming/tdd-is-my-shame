# TDD is my Shame

The general idea is that, increasingly, people seem uncomfortable doing TDD. They have rarely been taught it by an expert, instead trying to figure it out by themselves. This doesn't go well.

So the talk is to demystify the process, what works and what doesn't, where it fits contextually, the benefits, the downsides, some techniques that help.

## Abstract

"I don't do as much Test-Driven Development as I should; it's my shame."

The more time I spend at recent development conferences, the more I see this sentiment echoed. Developers get the impression that they *should* do TDD, but they don't.

Sometimes they don't know how to do it effectively, so it ends up a mess.
Sometimes they don't know when they should do it, so it ends up being overapplied.
Sometimes they don't really know what it is, so they end up treating it in odd ways.

In this talk, you'll get answers for all of the above and more. You'll understand TDD better, you'll understand how to be more effective, and you'll learn to let go of that little voice that says you should do more.

## Short version

"I don't do as much Test-Driven Development as I should; it's my shame."

The more time I spend at recent development conferences, the more I see this sentiment echoed. Developers get the impression that they *should* do TDD, but they don't.

Messy code? Misunderstandings? Inexperienced? I can help.

In this talk, you'll understand TDD better, how to be more effective, and how to let go of that little voice that says you should do more.

## 100 Chars or less

"I don't do much Test-Driven Development; it's my shame." Let's change this together.



## Key Outcomes

* You'll know when you should be using TDD, and when not.
* You'll understand what "Driven" really means in this context.
* You'll see a number of practical tips and techniques to stop your tests becoming unmanageable.

## Agenda

The rough agenda (subject to rearrangement) is:

* 5-10 minutes explaining what TDD is and isn't.
* 10 minutes or so on why people feel the way they do about TDD and why they probably shouldn't
* 10 minutes on how to use TDD effectively
* 15 minutes on interactive examples of where people go wrong
