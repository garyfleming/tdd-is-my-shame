^ This is a sudoku puzzle. It's a pretty simple idea that can be quite complicated if you're not used to it. It's a 9x9 grid, separated into 9 3x3 boxes. You solve it by placing the numbers 1-9 exactly once in each column, each row, and each 3x3.

^ I remember them first becoming popular in the UK when I was at university. Various newspapers would print them beside the traditional crossword puzzle. I always found them frustrating. This one was graded as easy. Of the 81 cells, 38 cells are already filled. About half. Most people, given the rules, can figure them out with a bit of time and guessing. These ones were not why I was frustrated.

^ This is a sudoku graded at Expert. 23 cells are prefilled. It's much harder. There's an entire box without numbers. How do you fill this in?, I though.. Pure witchcraft. I gave up.

# TDD is My Shame
### A Preview


---

![](images/CODE-CRAFT-V2-01-09.svg)

^ I run a meetup called CodeCraft, that focusses on the craft of writing good software. It was kind of a spin-off from this meetup... Don't worry, this isn't a pitch for that meetup: it's just where the story starts.

---

![](images/CODE-CRAFT-V2-01-09.svg)

^ A few years ago, we were running a session on either mob or pair programming, I don't remember which, but there was an unusual argument that broke out in one of the groups but dissipated before we could intervene and figure out what was wrong.

---

# Pub / Plato

^ Afterwards, a few of us went to a nearby pub, given the grey miserable weather, to continue our conversation. One of the attendees, who I'll call Plato, seemed unusually perturbed. When I asked him, what was wrong, he mentioned that he was feeling some pretty severe imposter syndrome after the session. Plato looked deeply uncomfortable, in a way that only a 2500 year old man whose world view has been crushed can. The argument had made him realise something:

---

> "I'm a little ashamed, but I don't TDD as much as I think I should."

^ There's a *lot* packed into that one little sentence. Layers, and nuance, and meaning. We decided to spend a while dealing with it.

---

^ Since that conversation on that night, all those years ago, I've spoken and attended a number of conferences and meetups around the world. As a consultant, I also get to work with a lot of developers of different ages, backgrounds, etc. When I can, I keep asking people the same question:

---

"Do you TDD?"

^ Put your hand up if you've do TDD for most of your production code?

^ The phrasing changes, the context shifts, but I've asked a tonne of developers how and when they TDD. While no-one does it 100% of the time (well, one person claimed to, but we'll introduce him later), one thing that's become very clear to me: the number of developers who routinely do TDD is *miniscule*. Tiny. A fraction of a percent. And it appears to be getting smaller.

---

# Shame

^ Worse, it appears to regularly be accompanied by shame. People feel they ought to do TDD, but they don't, and they often can't articulate why.

---

# What is Shame?


^ So what is shame? I'm clearly not a psychologist, psychiatrist, or therapist, so I'll tread pretty lightly here. Shame is rooted in vulnerability, but manifests in many ways. A number of things can contribute to the experience of shame.

---

# What is Shame?

* Self-awareness
* Self-blame
* Standards
* Personal trait
* Self-esteem
* ... and more

^ Sometimes it's simple social faux pas (turning up to a social event wearing casual when everyone else is formal),
sometimes it's looking for causation and coming up short so blaming yourself,
Breaching some kind of standard convention like laughing unexpectedly at a funeral,
It can be low self-esteem - directing things going wrong at yourself as an almost reflexive action

---

## "Listening To Shame" by Brené Brown

^ There's a great TED talk by Brene Brown called... It's worth watching the whole thing but I want to call attention to something she points out about how Shame manifests differently for men and women

---

> "Shame, for women, is this web of unobtainabd4le, conflicting, competing expectations about who we're supposed to be. And it's a straight-jacket. "
> - Brené Brown

^ (Read the quote. Pause) I'm sure that might resonate with some of you. For men, it's mostly just one thing.

---

# Don't be Weak

^ Don't be weak. A whole bunch of societal damage has been done and continues to be done by the self-reenforcing idea that men mustn't be weak. That's a whole talk... maybe a whole series of podcats.... all by itself..

---

# TDD and Shame


^ So what is it all these developers are experiencing when they say they don't do TDD, and why? It probably really is shame. It's yet another thing for them to do that they don't; a reminder of their lack of perfection. It's another way in which society might perceive them as weak.

---

# You're Good Enough

^ As much as I'm going to spend the rest of this talk telling you about how great TDD is and how to do it, you are good enough. You don't need to feel bad about not doing it. You're not better if you do. Do what you can. Learn what you can. But you're good enough.

What is TDD?

Let's start by taking a big question off the table.

TODO bunch of stuff explaing the big picture, then the Liz keogh stuff about how it's an anchor term. and Rob jeffries on how things get smushed on top of each other

-->

---

# Why feel shame?

^ I asked Plato why he felt SHAME specifically. He said that he found the whole idea overwhelming: it was too big, and any time he'd tried he failed, and he'd never know enough. This was imposter syndrome manifest.. I offered three pieces of advice


---

# 1. Satir(ish)

^ TODO Virgina Satir was a therapist. Did a lot of work on change. Can't get into the details here, but well worth reading her work

---

![inline original fit](images/curve.jpg)

^ explain the changes

---

# 2. No One True TDD.

^ I also explained that there really isn't one thing called TDD. We like to pretend that TDD is a thing and you can just do it... but that's not quite true. The practices involved and the processes and the people doing it all... mush together. RJ says That's how ideas are. Mushy. It's like a bunch of different play-doh making up something.

---

# Anchor Terms

^ Liz Keogh describes TDD as an anchor term. It's a useful term for searching and tying these mushy ideas together. If you want to know more about ideas in the space, searching for TDD will probably tell you something useful; which is better than trying to find all the individual practices.

---

# 3. Shu-Ha-Ri

^ Everyone is a beginner. That's okay. That's how we all start. There's an idea, that is somewhat misunderstood but probably applies here: shuhari.

Why do so few developers do it?

Tips for doing it better

- rules of simple design
- immutability

TODO everything below here are from false starts.

When I knew I was going to be speaking about TDD, I decided that it would be a good idea to ask as many people as possible, both online and offline, about their experiences of TDD. Did they like it? Did it help? etc

Most of the experienced people I spoke to gave the same answers we've seen many times before, essentially the selling points. That is:

* It gives them more confidence that they can change their code later.
* Fewer bugs
* Living documentation.
* It helps them think through a design.
etc

A small, but not insignificant number said something different. It was articulated by one of the last people I spoke to: "I'm a little ashamed, but I don't TDD as much as I think I should."

There's a lot packed into that little sentence, so I want to spend some time exploring it.

TODO

---

^ When I was first said I'd do a talk on TDD, I thought it would be easy enough. I've been practicing TDD to some degree for around a decade now. As a software and agile consultant, I also spend a lot of my time helping other people to do TDD.

I had, however, forgotten that context is king.

When someone asked me to spend an hour or so with them to show them how to do TDD, it was a surprising challenge. I'd gotten used to spending weeks or months with teams, helping them learn the nuance of TDD as their problems emerged. Trying to distill it all down into an hour or so didn't work well.

There's a LOT to learn. It takes time and practice.


---

"I don't TDD as much as I think I should"
"to some degree"
" you're going to test on way or another" - driven, first, after, or in prod.

why do people who know that it works not always do it? Why can it be hard? How can we make it easier?

Talk a bit about handing over LA Portal (not directly) -- People questioning the tests. Mostly they weren't used to a technique I use (no mocks), which was fine; but the process did show me that some of the tests we had were going to be brittle. --that is, even with years of experience, there will always be things you don't like. You're getting better.

Shu-ha-ri?
