# Possible TODOs.

* Brian Marick on a better style for tests (i.e. don't assert_equal) https://twitter.com/marick/status/1140021311974137857
* Brian Marick (again) on test data and randomisation being clearer https://twitter.com/marick/status/1140713459988029441
* Note that randomisation means less predicatable data. That's a good thing. Relationship/meaning is the most important thing. Randomising also means you might find more edge cases that can then be codified. If you'd prefer some predictability, you can always keep the seed constant.
* Lots of stuff in this thread (both this and the earliest part being quote tweeted by GeePaw Hill) about developer exceptionalism. An argument I put forward is that devs should be at least as interruptible as other disciplines and a tight red-green-refactor aids that: https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/1145461742350323712
* More on Dev Exceptionalism and tight TDD loops: https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/1144164533549838336
* Test fixtures: https://twitter.com/marick/status/1172342543490662401
* Seb on unit tests rarely being written as expected: https://twitter.com/sebrose/status/1184030238931595264
