# Possible TODOs.

* framing. Ritualism? How powerful that is? Maybe use coffee as our opener. It’s not addictive but does cause dependence, and ritualistic but biochemically doesn’t do much at all. -- Maybe not.
* Brian Marick on a better style for tests (i.e. don't assert_equal) https://twitter.com/marick/status/1140021311974137857
* Brian Marick (again) on test data and randomisation being clearer https://twitter.com/marick/status/1140713459988029441
* Note that randomisation means less predicatable data. That's a good thing. Relationship/meaning is the most important thing. Randomising also means you might find more edge cases that can then be codified. If you'd prefer some predictability, you can always keep the seed constant.
* Lots of stuff in this thread (both this and the earliest part being quote tweeted by GeePaw Hill) about developer exceptionalism. An argument I put forward is that devs should be at least as interruptible as other disciplines and a tight red-green-refactor aids that: https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/1145461742350323712

* Seb Rose on unit tests rarely being written as expected: https://twitter.com/sebrose/status/1184030238931595264
* Sarah mei on TDD not working for a heterogenous team: https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/990594488052559874, and https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/990968833547497472 (Expanded/Easier to read version: https://retrosight.github.io/learning/why-agile-xp-so-often-fails-heterogenous-teams-sarah-mei.html)
* My initial reaction to Sarah Mei's tweets was strong disagreement, because I'd seen them work well in heterogenous groups. But I have to own my own privilege here: I'm privileged, and I need to put more time into seeing it through other lenses. Consider the issues here. -- Practices and power dynamics
* "Why are Rooie rules nice" - Brian Marick on why things that look rule-bound often need more work https://twitter.com/marick/status/1208748304311496704

* Thread on whether TDD is a design practice. I like Antony Marcano's answer: https://twitter.com/AntonyMarcano/status/1213421222010277888
