# Possible TODOs.

* Brian Marick on a better style for tests (i.e. don't assert_equal) https://twitter.com/marick/status/1140021311974137857
* Brian Marick (again) on test data and randomisation being clearer https://twitter.com/marick/status/1140713459988029441
* Note that randomisation means less predicatable data. That's a good thing. Relationship/meaning is the most important thing. Randomising also means you might find more edge cases that can then be codified. If you'd prefer some predictability, you can always keep the seed constant.
